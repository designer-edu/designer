What is Designer and its Research?
----------------------------------

======
What is Designer?
======

Designer is an open-source Python graphics and game library. What makes it different from all of the other ones out there?

Designer's developers are committed to conducting iterative research to evaluate how students interact with Designer
and its API. They use this research to guide API decisions.

======
Research Data and Analysis
======

`Data`_ used to guide the current version of Designer is publicly available and includes analysis and choices regarding fundamental API concepts such as function naming conventions and vocabulary regarding visual output, game objects, and movement.

You can read our `paper`_ "Designing Designer: The Evidence-Oriented Design Process of a Pedagogical Interactive Graphics Python Library",
published at the 2022 ACM SIGCSE Technical Symposium.
