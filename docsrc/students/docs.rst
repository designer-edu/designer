Creating DesignerObjects
------------------------

.. _image:

.. function:: image(path)
              image(path, x, y)

    Function to create an image from the given ``path``. The ``path`` given
    can be a local file or a URL to a remote image. Keep in mind that
    loading large URLs can take a little while.

    .. code-block:: python

        from designer import *
        # A random corgi picture from a website
        image("http://placecorgi.com/260/180")

    We recommend always storing images as local files in adjacent folders,
    to simplify problems with paths. Never use absolute file locations like
    ``C:/Users/acbart...`` or ``/usr/acbart/``, but instead use relative paths.

    Most popular image formats are supported: ``png``, ``gif``, ``bmp``, ``jpeg``.

    Animated gifs are partially supported, although many suffer from corruption.

    :param path: local file path or url of image to use
    :type path: str
    :param x: horizontal location to draw the image
    :type x: int
    :param y: vertical location to draw the image
    :type y: int
    :return: Image object created
    :rtype: DesignerObject

.. _emoji:

.. function:: emoji(name)
              emoji(name, x, y)

    Function to create an emoji of the given ``name``. You can also provide the actual unicode character.
    Not every unicode emoji is supported. You can find a `searchable emoji list here <https://emojis.wiki/>`_. Copy
    paste the emoji as a string literal as the ``name`` argument.

    .. code-block:: python

        from designer import *
        # Either of these will create a picture of a dog on your screen
        emoji("dog")
        emoji("üêï")

    :param name: The unicode name of the emoji, or the unicode character of the emoji.
    :type name: str
    :param x: horizontal location to draw the emoji
    :type x: int
    :param y: vertical location to draw the emoji
    :type y: int

              text(color, text, size, x, y, font_name='Arial', font_path=None)

    Function to create text on the screen with the given color.
    Not all unicode characters are supported!

    :param y: top most y-coordinate of text
    :type y: int
    :param font_name: The name of the font to use. Defaults to 'Arial'.
    :type font_name: str
    :param font_path: The path to the font to use. Ignored if font_name is already a font.
    :type font_path: str
    :return: Text object created
    :rtype: DesignerObject

.. _rectangle:

.. py:function:: rectangle(color, width, height)
                 rectangle(color, width, height, x, y)
                 rectangle(color, width, height, x, y, border=None, anchor='center')

    Function to create a rectangle object. You must specify the color, width, and height
    of the rectangle. Optionally, you can also position it at a specific x/y coordinate,
    although it will default to the center of the Window.

    And like any other shape, you can specify an :ref:`anchor<anchor>` to adjust the "pin" of the
    object relative to its position.

    .. code-block:: python

        # Blue 50x50 rectangle drawn from the topleft corner, at position 0,0
        rectangle("blue", 50, 50, 0, 0, anchor='topleft')

        from designer import *
        # Black circle of radius 100
        circle("black", 100)

        # Red circle of radius 50 in topleft corner
        # Part of the circle will be caught off since its drawn from the center
        red_circle = circle("red", 50, 0, 0)

.. function:: line(color, start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y)
              line(color, start_x, start_y, end_x, end_y, thickness=1)

    Function to create a line, beginning at the coordinates given by
    ``(start_x, start_y)`` and ending at the coordinates given by
    ``(end_x, end_y)``. These coordinates are given as absolute values,
    and must be provided.

    .. code-block:: python

        # Blue line stretching from 0,0, to 50, 100

    :type thickness: int
    :return: Line designer object created
    :rtype: DesignerObject

.. _arc:

.. function:: arc(color, start_angle, stop_angle, width, height)
              arc(color, start_angle, stop_angle, width, height, x, y)
              arc(color, start_angle, stop_angle, width, height, x, y, thickness=1, anchor='center')

    Function to make an arc, as if it were part of an ellipse. Think of the
    arc as being part of the border of an ellipse with the given width/height;
    then the ``start_angle`` and ``stop_angle`` are the slice (in degrees) of the
    border that will actually be drawn. This is a line, not a polygon, so there
    is no option to fill in the arc.

    .. code-block:: python

        from designer import *
        # Black arc of size 100x100, from 0 to 90 degrees (quarter circle)
        arc("black", 0, 90, 100, 100)
        # Black arc of size 100x100, from 135 to 270 degrees (2/3 circle)
        arc("black", 135, 270, 100, 100)

        # Red U of size 50x50 in topleft corner
        # Part will be cut off unless you change the anchor!
        red_U = arc("red", 180, 360, 50, 50, 0, 0)

        # Once created, you can manipulate the thickness and other properties
        red_U.anchor = 'topleft'
        red_U.thickness = 10

    :param color: The :ref:`color<color>` of the arc
    :type color: str
    :param start_angle: angle in degrees to start drawing arc at
    :type start_angle: int
    :param stop_angle: angle in degrees to stop drawing arc at
    :type stop_angle: int
    :param width: The horizontal width of the arc, as if it were a complete ellipse
    :type width: int
    :param height: The vertical height of the arc, as if it were a complete ellipse
    :type height: int
    :param x: left most x-coordinate of arc

              shape(color, points)

    Function to create a shape of at least three points. The points should be relative to each other.
    The resulting image will be centered in the middle of the window, which can be adjusted by using ``x`` and ``y``.
    If you want to absolutely position the image instead, then use ``lines``.

    :param color: color of shape.
    :type color: str
    :param points: coordinates of points of shape
    :type points: List[Tuple] in (x, y), (x, y) format of points to be connected of shape
    :return: Shape object created

.. _lines:

.. function:: lines(color, x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, ...)
              lines(color, points)

    Function to create a shape of at least three points. The points will be absolutely positioned in the window.

    :param color: color of shape.
    :type color: str
    :param points: coordinates of points of shape
    :type points: List[Tuple] in (x, y), (x, y) format of points to be connected of shape
    :return: Shape object created

.. _group:

.. function:: group(object1, ...)
              group(objects)

    Function to group any number of Designer ``objects`` together. They will produce one single picture when they are done.
    The advantage of grouping together a bunch of objects is that they become easier to rotate and scale together.

    :param objects: collection of objects to be grouped together for collective functionality
    :type objects: at least one DesignerObject
    :return: Created Designer Group object


Designer Objects Attributes
---------------------------

.. automodule:: designer.DesignerObject

.. py:attribute:: x

        # Move 5 pixels left
        box.x -= 5

.. py:attribute:: y
    :type: integer

    The vertical position of the object on the screen.

    .. code-block:: python

        box = rectangle('red', 50, 50)
        # Set to be 100 pixels from the top of the window
        box.y = 100
        # Move 5 pixels up
        box.y -= 5

.. py:attribute:: width
    :type: integer

    The horizontal size of the object on the screen.

    .. code-block:: python

        box = rectangle('red', 50, 50)
        # Set to be 100 pixels wide
        box.width = 100
        # Increase width by 10 pixels
        box.width += 10

.. py:attribute:: height
    :type: integer

    The vertical size of the object on the screen.

    .. code-block:: python

        box = rectangle('red', 50, 50)
        # Set to be 100 pixels tall
        box.height = 100
        # Increase height by 10 pixels
        box.height += 10

.. py:attribute:: scale_x
    :type: float

    How much to multiply the object's width by in calculating its final horizontal
    size on the screen.

    .. code-block:: python

        box = rectangle('red', 50, 50)
        # Will be drawn twice as wide
        box.scale_x = 2.0
        # Will be drawn half as wide
        box.scale_x = .5

.. py:attribute:: scale_y
    :type: float

    How much to multiply the object's height by in calculating its final vertical
    size on the screen.

    .. code-block:: python

        # Will be drawn twice as tall
        box.scale_y = 2.0
        # Will be drawn half as tall
        box.scale_y = .5

.. py:attribute:: angle
    :type: float

    An amount to rotate the image, in degrees (0-360). You can provide negative
    values and amounts greater than 360.

    .. code-block:: python

        box = rectangle('red', 50, 50)
        # Will be drawn at a 45 degree angle
        box.angle = 45
        # Rotates it 180 degrees around
        box.angle += 180

.. py:attribute:: flip_x
    :type: boolean

    Whether or not to horizontally mirror this shape to the other direction.
    Note that symmetric shapes have no effect when they are mirrored, even
    if they are rotated. The order of transformations is flipping, scaling,
    and then rotating.

    .. code-block:: python

        ada = image('ada.png', 50, 50)
        # Will be flipped horizontally
        ada.flip_x = True
        # Will not be flipped horizontally
        ada.flip_x = False

.. py:attribute:: flip_y
    :type: boolean

    Whether or not to vertically mirror this shape to the other direction.
    Note that symmetric shapes have no effect when they are mirrored, even
    if they are rotated. The order of transformations is flipping, scaling,
    and then rotating.

    .. code-block:: python

        ada = image('ada.png', 50, 50)
        # Will be flipped vertically
        ada.flip_y = True
        # Will not be flipped vertically
        ada.flip_y = False

.. py:attribute:: visible
    :type: boolean

    Whether or not this object should actually be drawn on screen, or whether
    it will be hidden. Objects that are invisible still get "update" events.

    .. code-block:: python

        box = rectangle('red', 50, 50)
        # Will not be drawn
        ada.visible = False
        # Will be drawn
        ada.visible = True

.. py:attribute:: alpha
    :type: float

    A value from 0..1 indicating the amount of transparency (or "opacity") that
    this object should have when it is being drawn on the screen.

    .. code-block:: python

        box = rectangle('red', 50, 50)
        # Partially transparent
        ada.alpha = .5
        # Fully invisible
        ada.alpha = 0.0
        # Fully visible
        ada.alpha = 1.0

.. py:attribute:: layer
    :type: string

    A string indicating the layer that this object should be drawn on. Objects
    with the same layer will be drawn on top of each other in the order that
    they were created. The order of the layers should be set using :py:func:`set_window_layers`
    function, providing a list of the layer names (strings) in order from bottom to top.

    Alternatively, you can force a specific object to be drawn on top of all other layers using the ``"top"`` layer
    or below everything using the ``"bottom"`` layers, which are built in.

    There are also layer modifiers, which can be used to relatively position objects within layers:

    - ``"layer_name:top"``
    - ``"layer_name:above"``
    - ``"layer_name"``
    - ``"layer_name:below"``
    - ``"layer_name:bottom"``

    Swap out the name of the layer for the layer you want to modify. For example, if you have a layer called
    ``"background"`` and you want to draw an object on top of everything else in that layer, you would use
    ``"background:top"``. Note that you cannot use these modifiers with the ``"top"`` and ``"bottom"`` layers,
    but they can be used without a layer name to modify the default layer.

    .. code-block:: python

        box = rectangle('red', 20, 50)
        box2 = rectangle('blue', 50, 20)
        # box on top
        box.layer = 'top'
        # box on bottom
        box.layer = 'bottom'

        # box2 above box
        box.layer = 'below
        box2.layer = 'above'

        # Can only call set_window_layer once, but makes things explicit
        set_window_layers(['background', 'foreground'])
        box.layer = 'background'
        box2.layer = 'foreground'
        # Make circle in background layer appear behind everything else
        green_circle = circle('green', 200, 200)
        green_circle.layer = 'background:bottom'

.. py:attribute:: scale
    :type: [scale_x, scale_y]

    The combined horizontal and vertical scale of the object on the screen,
    as a list of two values. You can also set a single value in order to control
    both properties at the same time.


.. py:attribute:: size
    :type: [width, height]

    The combined width and height of the object on the screen, as a list of two values.

.. py:attribute:: pos
    :type: [x, y]

    The position of the object on the screen, as a list of two values.


Designer Object Functions

.. py:function:: move_forward(object, amount)
                 move_forward(object, amount, angle)

    Move the given ``object`` forward by ``amount``, either in its current rotation
    ``angle`` attribute or the given ``angle``. This changes the ``x`` and ``y`` attribute
    of the Designer Object, in addition to returning the value.

    :param object: A Designer Object
    :type object: DesignerObject
    :param amount: The number of pixels to move
    :type amount: int
    :param angle: The direction (in degrees) to move in; defaults to the object's current ``angle`` attribute (which defaults to 0).
    :type angle: int

    :return: The Designer Object that was passed in.
    :rtype: DesignerObject

Animation
---------

.. automodule:: designer.animation
   :members: linear_animation, sequence_animation

Settings
--------

.. _get_width:

.. py:function:: get_width()

    Returns the horizontal size of the Window.

    :rtype: int

.. _get_height:

.. py:function:: get_height()

    Returns the vertical size of the Window.

    :rtype: int

.. _set_window_title:

.. py:function:: set_window_height(message)
                 set_window_height(None)

    Changes the caption displayed at the top of the window. If you set the message to
    be ``None`` instead, then it will render internal debug information about the
    number of static and non-static objects being drawn on the screen.

    :param message: The text to render in the screen.
    :param type: str


.. py:function:: set_window_color(color)

    Changes the background color of the window to whatever :ref:`color<color>` you specify.
    Defaults to ``'white'``.

    .. code-block:: python

        from designer import *
        # Black text that reads "Hello world!"
        set_window_color('blue')

    :param color: The :ref:`color<color>` to set the background to.
    :param type: str

.. py:function:: background_image(path)

    :param path: local file path or url of image to use
    :type path: str

    Changes the background of the window to the image. The ``path`` given
    can be a local file or a URL to a remote image. Keep in mind that
    loading large URLs can take a little while.

.. py:function:: set_window_layers(layer_names)

    :param layer_names: List of layer names in order from bottom to top
    :type layer_names: list[str]

    Sets the order of the layers in the window. The first layer in the list will be drawn first, and the last layer
    in the list will be drawn last. The order of the layers is important, because objects in the same layer will
    be drawn on top of each other in the order that they were created. You can use layer modifiers to relatively
    position objects within layers. See the documentation on the ``layer`` attribute for more information.

Events
------

.. _when:

.. py:function:: when(event_name, event_handler)
                 when(predicate_function, event_handler)
                 when('starting', event_handler)
                 when('updating', event_handler)
                 when('typing', event_handler)
                 when('clicking', event_handler)

    Binds the function given by ``event_handler`` to the ``event_name``.

Collisions
----------

.. _colliding:

.. py:function:: colliding(object, x, y) -> bool
                 colliding(object, other_object) -> bool

    Tests if the object is colliding with either the point or the other object.

    :param object: A DesignerObject
    :type object: DesignerObject
    :param x: The horizontal position to check.
    :type x: int
    :param y: The vertical position to check.
    :type y: int
    :param other_object: Another DesignerObject to check against.
    :type other_object: DesignerObject
    :rtype: bool

Game Control
------------

.. _stop:

.. py:function:: stop()

    Stops the game completely, closing the window.

.. _pause:

.. py:function:: pause()

    Pauses the game, keeping the window open and whatever the last thing to draw was.
    However, no further events will be processed (besides the ``'quitting'`` event).
